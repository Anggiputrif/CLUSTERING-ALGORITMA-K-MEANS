# CLUSTERING-ALGORITMA-K-MEANS
Research Background :
At the end of 2019 the world was shocked by the covid-19 case. This virus has spread and has an impact on the economies of countries in the world. The economic conditions of several countries are currently experiencing a slowdown due to covid-19. This is due to a slowdown in domestic investment, exports and imports. Because the impact of the socio-economic and health crisis felt by each country is different, the question arises how to help the HELP International organization determine the countries that need the most help when viewed from socio-economic and health factors?

Method :
The method used in this project is Exploratory Data Analysis whose function is to explore data and use the K-means Algorithm to classify data.
Analysis steps :
1)	Reading and Understanding Data
2)	Exploratory Data Analysis
3)	Outliers Treatment
4)	Scaling Data
5)	Creating k means clustering and visualizing clusters formed
6)	Report countries

Result :
Clustering by socio-ekonomic factor
Top 3 lowest countriest in socio-economic factors 
1) **Congo, Dem. Rep**
2) Liberia
3) Burgundi

Clustering by health factor
10 countries with the lowest Health factor
1) Haiti
2) Sierra Leone
3) Chad
4) Central African Republic
5) Mali
6) Nigeria
7) Niger
8) Angola
9) Burkina Faso
10) **Congo, Dem. Rep**

So :
- There are countries that appear repeatedly in the results of the clustering process both from health factors and social and economic factors. These countries are Congo, Dem. Rep.
- The number of child deaths is arguably quite high but has a not too large amount of fertility, namely the country of Congo, Dem. Rep.
- **We recommend the HELP International organization to provide assistance to the country of Congo Rep. Dem**.
